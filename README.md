# RedisFinalProject

Our group made extensions to the LAMP assignment using a Redis database. The LAMP assignment involved saving names generated by the randomuser.me API to a MariaDB database and returning a static HTML page generated by PHP that showed all the names in the database. Our group took this project and allowed users to search the MariaDB database with a live search bar without returning a whole new HTML page to display the database. We also added and used a Redis database as a caching layer to highlight Redis's speed compared to an SQL database like MariaDB. Users could search the slow MariaDB database, add names, and use a Redis database on the school server to cache all the name values into the super-fast Redis database. We also have a timing mechanism to show Redis's speed in delivering all names compared to MariaDB.

## Creative Objective

The main goal of this project was to learn why Redis was becoming so popular and, more importantly, to learn how to use it or implement it in a project. Our team wanted to highlight what makes Redis different than a traditional database. We did this by enhancing the LAMP assignment, adding a live search bar, and incorporating Redis as a caching layer to improve performance. The project aimed to provide a smoother user experience and showcase the speed of Redis compared to a traditional SQL database like MariaDB.

## Tech Summary

Our project is hosted on the course server, port 3084, using NodeJS. The specific Node packages we used include `mysql`, `express`, `cors`, and `redis`. Users need to install these packages using `npm install (package name)`. We also use a MariaDB database hosted on the course server and a publicly accessible Redis database. Users can change the database credentials in the `server.js` file. To start the code, run `node server.js` from inside the `databaseTest` folder, and open the `index.html` file in the browser.

## Individual Member Notes

### Ivan

My contribution to the project was setting up the Redis server and the NodeJS server on which we hosted our website. I researched Redis and how to implement it into a NodeJS-hosted website. I also resolved challenges related to hosting the website on the school server. After setting up the Redis server on the course server, I connected the website to both databases and handed it off to my partner.

### Matthew

My contribution to the site included adding extra functionality, displaying data and the user interface on the same page, dynamically searching the database for first names, and implementing a timer to measure the performance increase from having a Redis cache. I also added a way to flush the Redis cache and styled the `index.html` page for a pleasant appearance.

## Conclusion

Our group gained extensive knowledge about back-end development through this project. We learned the challenges of setting up a front-end website that directly interacts with a database and the importance of communication in overcoming such challenges. The project provided insights into hosting databases, monitoring them using third-party tools, and improving performance with a Redis database. This experience equips us to attach databases to websites in the future, secure them if needed, and implement Redis databases for significant performance improvements.
